description: The fun and typos when coding with cats - especially Boo the cat.

It's wonderful working from home. I've been doing it on and off for decades. However, there are challenges as well as anyone with pets (or kids, or partners) will know well. I have three rescue cats. Though nine times out of then it's Boo that interrupts Zoom meetings, and distracts me right at the exact minute I need to avoid a typo. 

Boo is full of love and fun and mischeif. His favourite game is "getting the human to chase the cat" followed by "getting human to cuddle cat". He figured out that getting into the recycling, grabbing a plastic wrapper (or an entire huge bag), and running off with it means I instantly run after him. He's developing a feline sixth sense for whenever I type "npm ..." or "config ..." anything.

After much debugging, chasing of Boo, catching Boo, threatening Boo with bathtime, bribing Boo with too many Temptations cat treats, the delay in fixing this site was found to be a one character typo in a config file. Given that I created that file while Boo was outdoing himself in getting his human's attention this was definately a #codingwithcats error.
