#JAMStack BLog

This is my first JAMStack project and the first one hosted on Netlify. The inspiration was Kevin Powell's YouTube tutorial (https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g) plus my need to have more control over the design and accessibilty of my blog.

I unfortunatly broke it when I was adding the CMS. (I'm partially blaming one of my cats who was getting into mischief during that process!) So I rolled things back to the first gen of templates (before I updated the design from the tutorial and added my own articles). I'm fixing it today starting from scratch, Thursday, May 26th, 2022 in this new repo.
